Our GradientDescent function can be found here: [GradientDescent](https://github.com/Alex-Lacy/CS499-Project-1/blob/master/GradientDescent.m)

However, it is easily accessed and used through our Driver function, [ROC](https://github.com/Alex-Lacy/CS499-Project-1/blob/master/ROC.m)

To run our algorithm on a particular dataset, first you have to import the dataset at the beginning of the code.  
If you wish to use one of the datasets provided, you will need to un-comment or re-comment the appropriate section.

After initializing your data or uncommenting the initializations provided (please see [Stanford's data reposity](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html) for actual data files)
you will need to un-comment both lines of the splitdata function.  Without changing code, these appear on lines 86 and 87 of [ROC](https://github.com/Alex-Lacy/CS499-Project-1/blob/master/ROC.m)

That's it! Run the code and watch the algorithm work!
